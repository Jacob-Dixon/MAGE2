===BEGIN Front IO PCB===
PCB's manufactured prior to Revision 2 on 11/22/2015 are subject to the following Errata:
1. RESET pin on connector not connected due to net mis-labeling. Through testing, it is found that it is best to have RESET tied to VCC. Revision 2 ties RESET to VCC and does not use the RESET pin on the connector.
2. Part LED4 is flipped 180 degrees with respect to the other LED's. Follow dot markings in silk screen for correct orientation.
===END Front IO PCB=== 

===BEGIN IR DISTRO BOARD===
1. The center hole on the the Distro board is designed for a 14.2mm hat button. Velcro is needed for mounting for any button smaller, and a hat with a larger button is not reccommended for the MAGE system.
===END IR DISTRO BOARD===

===BEGIN IR & HAPTIC FEEDBACK BOARD===	
All revisions of the board are functional. Revision 2 has the silkscreen outline of the motor corrected to be on the front of the PCB.
